# Remirror Next.js example

This is a small project demonstrating the usage of remirror with Next.JS.

## Getting started

Clone the remirror repository, install the dependencies, and then change to this folder and run
`yarn dev`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:remirror/remirror.git
cd remirror
yarn
yarn build
cd examples/with-next
yarn dev
```

After a few seconds you should receive a `[ ready ]` message, and a URL to open such as
http://localhost:3000. You can use the links at the top to visit different examples:
