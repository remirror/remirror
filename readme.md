## Motivation

`remirror` was started as a personal challenge. Would it be possible to build an editor that combined great performance with ease of use? It was also important to give users of all frameworks, the ability to build an editor by picking and choosing their desired building blocks.

In order to meet these goals, [ProseMirror][prosemirror] was picked as the best choice for the core editor layer. The second decision was to base the structure of the editor on blocks of functionality called `Extensions`. Each extension would be designed to fulfil a specific purpose in the editor. Due to this structure, users would be able to craft a fully custom implementation.

In the upcoming version of `remirror`, some of these initial goals are starting to be met. Every single part of the editor is controlled by extensions. For example, the core (`Schema`) is managed by a [built-in extension](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/blob/HEAD/packages/remirror__core/src/builtins/schema-extension.ts). This means that the editor you choose to build is completely customizable.

The API has also improved a lot. Multi-framework support is being added in the future. Currently the focus is on `React` and the `DOM`.

There are also a host of drop in components and hooks being developed. To get started with the simplest possible editor the following will suffice.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { BoldExtension, ItalicExtension, UnderlineExtension } from 'remirror/extensions';
import { Remirror, useRemirror } from '@remirror/react';

const extensions = () => [new BoldExtension(), new ItalicExtension(), new UnderlineExtension()];

const Editor = () => {
  const { manager, onChange, state } = useRemirror({
    extensions,
    content: '<p>Hi <strong>Friend</strong></p>',
    stringHandler: 'html',
    selection: 'end',
  });

  return <Remirror onChange={onChange} manager={manager} state={state} />;
};
```

With this small snippet your editor now supports some complex UI Functionality. And it's all customisable with ordinary `css`. If you prefer `CSS-in-JS` the styles are also available via `emotion` and `styled-components`.

There's so much more to come and I'm glad you're taking a look. I hope `remirror` proves to be everything you need for your next text editor project.

## Status

This is the `beta` branch of the `remirror` which will be fully released in the coming weeks.

In the meantime, you can install the beta version via the following command.

```bash
yarn add remirror@pr706 @remirror/react@pr706 # Yarn

npm install remirror@pr706 @remirror/react@pr706 # npm

pnpm add remirror@pr706 @remirror/react@pr706 # pnpm
```

<br />

## Getting Started

To add an editor to your codebase, first install the required dependencies. Make sure to include the `` tag so that the correct version is installed.

```bash
# yarn
yarn add remirror

# pnpm
pnpm add remirror

# npm
npm install remirror
```

## Usage

Once installed you will be able to add the following code which creates an editor with the bold extension active. Clicking the button when text is selected will toggle between bold.

```tsx
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { BoldExtension } from 'remirror/extensions';
import {
  EditorComponent,
  Remirror,
  useActive,
  useCommands,
  useHelpers,
  useKeymap,
  useRemirror,
} from '@remirror/react';

const Button = () => {
  // `autoUpdate` means that every editor update will recalculate the output
  // from `active.bold()` and keep the bold status up to date in the editor.
  const { bold } = useActive();

  return (
    <>
      <button
        onClick={() => commands.toggleBold()}
        style={{ fontWeight: bold() ? 'bold' : undefined }}
      >
        Bold
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

// Hooks can be added to the context without the need for creating custom components
const hooks = [
  () => {
    const { getJSON } = useHelpers();

    const onSave = useCallback(
      (props) => {
        const { state } = props;
        saveToBackend(getJSON(state));

        return true; // Prevents any further key handlers from being run.
      },
      [getJSON],
    );

    useKeymap('Mod-s', onSave);
  },
];

const Editor = () => {
  const { manager, state } = useRemirror({ extensions: () => [new BoldExtension()] });

  // The editor is built up like lego blocks of functionality within the editor
  // provider.
  return (
    <Remirror manager={manager} initialContent={state} hooks={hooks}>
      <Button />
      <EditorComponent />
    </Remirror>
  );
};
```

## Contributing

Please read our [contribution guide] for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests. It also outlines the project structure so you can find help when navigating your way around the codebase.

In addition each folder in this codebase includes a readme describing why it exists.

You might also notice there are surprisingly few files in the root directory of this project. All the configuration files have been moved to the `support/root` directory and are symlinked to the root directory in a `preinstall` hook. For more information take a look at [folder](support/root) and [readme](support/root/readme.md).

Finally you can keep track on what's being worked on via the [projects].
