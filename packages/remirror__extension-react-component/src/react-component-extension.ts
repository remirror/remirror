/**
 * The extension transforms the `ReactComponent` property on extensions into the
 * following:
 *
 * - a valid `NodeView` wrapped dom element
 * - a valid `SSR` component.
 *
 * Currently this only support nodes. Support will be added for marks later.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * When creating a NodeView using the component property the `toDOM` method
 * returned by the `createNodeSpec` methods needs to be in the following format.
 *
 * - `string` - e.g. `div`. This will be used as the wrapper tag name. .
 * - `[string, 0]` - The wrapper tag name and a `0` indicating that this will be
 *   accepting content.
 * - `[string, object, 0?]` -The wrapper tag name, an object of the attributes
 *   that should be applied to the wrapper tag and a 0 when you want the react
 *   component to have content inserted into it.
 *
 * Unfortunately `React Components` currently require a wrapping tag element
 * when being used in the DOM. See the following for the reasons.
 *
 * ### Caveats
 *
 * It's not possible to create a node view without nested dom element in `react`
 * due to this issue https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12227. It's
 * unlikely that this limitation will be changed any time soon
 * https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror/issues/803
 *
 * NodeViews have a `dom` node which is used as the main wrapper element. For
 * paragraphs this would be the `p` tag and for text this is a `TEXT` node.
 * NodeView's  also have a `contentDOM` property which is where any content from
 * ProseMirror is injected.
 *
 * The difficulty in integration is that the dom node and the content dom node
 * of the `NodeView` are consumed synchronously by ProseMirror. However, react
 * requires a ref to capture the dom node which corresponds to the mounted
 * component. This is done asynchronously. As a result it's not possible to
 * provide the `dom` node or `contentDOM` to ProseMirror while using react.
 *
 * The only way around this is to create both the top level `dom` element and
 * the `contentDOM` element manually in the NodeView and provide a `forwardRef`
 * prop to the component. This prop must be attached to the part of the tree
 * where content should be rendered to. Once the React ref is available the
 * `forwardRef` prop appends the `contentDOM` to the element where `forwardRef`
 * was attached.
