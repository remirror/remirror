### Major Changes

- [#706](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/pull/706) [`adfb12a4c`](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/commit/adfb12a4cee7031eec4baa10830b0fc0134ebdc8) Thanks [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr)! - Here's what's changed in the beta release.

  - [x] Improved `react` API
  - [x] Full `markdown` support with the `@remirror/extension-markdown` package.
  - [x] Full formatting support
  - [x] i18n support
  - [x] A11y support for react via `reakit`
  - [ ] Component Library (work in progress)
  - [ ] Start adding experimental react native support (mostly done)
  - [ ] Todo list extension (not started)
  - [ ] New math extension (not started)
  - [ ] New pagination extension (not started)
  - [ ] New text wrap extension (not started)

  ### Delayed

  - ~Experimental svelte support~ - This will be added later in the year.

  ## Breaking

  - Upgrade minimum TypeScript version to `4.1`.
  - Editor selection now defaults to the `end` of the document.
  - Rename all `*Parameter` interfaces to `*Props`. With the exception of \[React\]FrameworkParameter which is now \[React\]FrameworkOptions.
  - Remove `Presets` completely. In their place a function that returns a list of `Extension`s should be used. They were clunky, difficult to use and provided little to no value.
  - Add core exports to `remirror` package
  - Add all Extensions and Preset package exports to the `remirror/extensions` subdirectory. It doesn't include framework specific exports which are made available from `@remirror/react`
  - Remove `remirror/react` which has been replaced by `@remirror/react`
  - `@remirror/react` includes which includes all the react exports from all the react packages which can be used with remirror.
  - Remove `@remirror/showcase` - examples have been provided on how to achieve the same effect.
  - Remove `@remirror/react-social`
  - Remove `@remirror/react-wysiwyg`
  - Rename `useRemirror` -> `useRemirrorContext`
  - Replace `useManager` with better `useRemirror` which provides a lot more functionality.
  - Rename `preset-table` to `extension-tables`
  - Rename `preset-list` to `extension-lists`. `ListPreset` is now `BulletListExtension` and `OrderListExtension`.
  - New `createDecorations` extension method for adding decorations to the prosemirror view.
  - Create new decorator pattern for adding `@commands`, `@helper` functions and `@keyBindings`.
  - Deprecate `tags` property on extension and encourage the use of `createTags` which is a method instead.
  - Add `onApplyState` and `onInitState` lifecycle methods.
  - Add `onApplyTransaction` method.
  - Rename interface `CreatePluginReturn` to `CreateExtensionPlugin`.
  - Rewrite the `DropCursor` to support animations and interactions with media.
  - Add support updating the doc attributes.
  - Deprecate top level context methods `focus` and `blur`. They should now be consumed as commands
  - Remove package `@remirror/extension-auto-link`.

  ### `ExtensionStore`

  - Rename `addOrReplacePlugins` to `updatePlugins` in `ExtensionStore`.
  - Remove `reconfigureStatePlugins` and auto apply it for all plugin updating methods.

  One of the big changes is a hugely improved API for `@remirror/react`.

  ### `@remirror/extension-positioner`

  - New `Rect` interface returned by the positioner `x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number;`
  - Added `visible` property which shows if the position currently visible within the editor viewport.
  - Improved scrolling when using the positioner.
  - Fixed a lot of bugs in the positioner API.
  - This DOMRect represents an absolute position within the document. It is up to your consuming component to consume the rect.
  - `@remirror/react-components` exports `PositionerComponent` which internally
  - Renamed the positioners in line with the new functionality.

  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { fromHtml, toHtml } from 'remirror';
  import { BoldExtension, CorePreset, ItalicExtension } from 'remirror/extension';
  import { Remirror, useRemirror, useRemirrorContext } from '@remirror/react';

  const Editor = () => {
    const { manager, onChange, state } = useRemirror({
      extensions: () => [new BoldExtension(), new ItalicExtension()],
      content: 'asdfasdf',
      stringHandler: '',
    });

    return <Remirror manager={manager} onChange={onChange} state={state} />;
  };
  ```

  When no children are provided to the

  The previous `useRemirror` is now called `useRemirrorContext` since it plucks the context from the outer `Remirror` Component. The `<RemirrorProvider />` has been renamed to `<Remirror />` and automatically renders an editor.

  `useManager` has been marked as `@internal` (although it is still exported) and going forward you should be using `useRemirror` as shown in the above example.

  Per library expected changes.

  ### `@remirror/extension-tables`

  With the new support for extensions which act as parents to other extensions the table extension has now become a preset extension. It is no longer needed and has been renamed to it's initial name

  ### UI Commands

  - Add commands with UI configuration and i18n text descriptions
  - `@command`, `@keyBinding`, `@helper` decorators for more typesafe configuration of extensions.
  - `NameShortcut` keybindings which can be set in the keymap extension
  - `overrides` property

  ### Accessibility as a priority

  Actively test for the following

  - [ ] Screen Readers
  - [ ] Braille display
  - [ ] Zoom functionality
  - [ ] High contrast for the default theme

  ### Caveats around inference

  - Make sure all your commands in an extension are annotated with a return type of `CommandFunction`. Failure to do so will break all type inference wherever the extension is used.

    ```ts
    import { CommandFunction } from 'remirror';
    ```

  - When setting the name of the extension make sure to use `as const` otherwise it will be a string and ruin autocompletion for extension names, nodes and marks.

    ```ts
    class MyExtension extends PlainExtension {
      get name() {
        return 'makeItConst' as const;
      }
    }
    ```

  ### `@remirror/react-hooks`

  - Rename `useKeymap` to `useKeymaps`. The original `useKeymap` now has a different signature.

  ```tsx
  import { useCallback } from 'react';
  import { BoldExtension } from 'remirror/extensions';
  import {
    Remirror,
    useHelpers,
    useKeymap,
    useRemirror,
    useRemirrorContext,
  } from '@remirror/react';

  const hooks = [
    () => {
      const active = useActive();
      const { insertText } = useCommands();
      const boldActive = active.bold();
      const handler = useCallback(() => {
        if (!boldActive) {
          return false;
        }

        return insertText.original('\n\nWoah there!')(props);
      }, [boldActive, insertText]);

      useKeymap('Shift-Enter', handler); // Add the handler to the keypress pattern.
    },
  ];

  const Editor = () => {
    const { manager } = useRemirror({ extensions: () => [new BoldExtension()] });

    return <Remirror manager={manager} hooks={hooks} />;
  };
  ```

  - The `Remirror` component now has a convenient hooks props. The hooks prop takes an array of zero parameter hook functions which are rendered into the `RemirrorContext`. It's a shorthand to writing out your own components. You can see the pattern in use above.

  ### Commands

  There are new hooks for working with commands.

  - Each command has an `original` method attached for using the original command that was used to create the command. The original command has the same type signature as the `(...args: any[]) => CommandFunction`. So you would call it with the command arguments and then also provide the CommandProps. This is useful when composing commands together or using commands within keyBindings which need to return a boolean.

    - You can see the `insertText.original` being used in the `useKeymap` example above.

  - `useCommands()` provides all the commands as hook. `useChainedCommands` provides all the chainable commands.

    ```tsx
    import { useCallback } from 'react';
    import { useChainedCommands, useKeymap } from '@remirror/react';

    function useLetItGo() {
      const chain = useChainedCommands();
      const handler = useCallback(() => {
        chain.selectText('all').insertText('Let it goo 🤫').run();
      }, [chain]);

      // Whenever the user types `a` they let it all go
      useKeymap('a', handler);
    }
    ```

  ### Dependencies

  - Upgrade React to require minimum versions of ^16.14.0 || ^17. This is because of the codebase now using the [new jsx transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html).
  - Upgrade TypeScript to a minimum of `4.1`. Several of the new features make use of the new types and it is a requirement to upgrade.
  - General upgrades across all dependencies to using the latest versions.
    - All `prosemirror-*` packages.
