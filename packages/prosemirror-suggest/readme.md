## The problem

You want to create a plugin for your prosemirror editor that responds to an activation character to create suggesters or options or actions for the user. Doing this from scratch can be difficult.

## This solution

`prosemirror-suggest` provides the suggestion primitives needed for building this functionality into your editor. You might be building user mentions, emoji search, an actions dropdown or anything that extracts a query from the editor after the activation character(s).

This implementation doesn't attempt to be magical. There's still a lot of work that goes into setting up your configuration. However, with this toolkit, you you will be building on a well-tested foundation with a structured API.

<br />

## Installation

```bash
# yarn
yarn add prosemirror-suggest prosemirror-view prosemirror-state prosemirror-keymap

# pnpm
pnpm add prosemirror-suggest prosemirror-view prosemirror-state prosemirror-keymap

# npm
npm install prosemirror-suggest prosemirror-view prosemirror-state prosemirror-keymap
```

The installation requires the installation of the peer dependencies `prosemirror-view`, `prosemirror-state` and `prosemirror-model` to avoid version clashes.

<br />

## Getting Started

This documentation will be updated soon.

`prosemirror-suggest` uses configuration objects called `Suggester`'s to define the behaviour of the suggesters you create. By calling the exported `suggest` method with all required `Suggester`'s the functionality is added to the editor in one plugin.

In the following example we're creating an emoji suggestion plugin that responds to the colon character with a query and presents a list of matching emojis based on the query typed so far.

```ts
import { schema } from 'prosemirror-schema-basic';
import { suggest, Suggester } from 'prosemirror-suggest';

const maxResults = 10;
let selectedIndex = 0;
let emojiList: string[] = [];
let showSuggestions = false;

const suggestEmojis: Suggester = {
  // By default decorations are used to highlight the currently matched
  // suggestion in the dom.
  // In this example we don't need decorations (in fact they cause problems when the
  // emoji string replaces the query text in the dom).
  noDecorations: true,
  char: ':', // The character to match against
  name: 'emoji-suggestion', // a unique name
  appendText: '', // Text to append to the created match

  // Keybindings are similar to prosemirror keymaps with a few extra niceties.
  // The key identifier can also include modifiers (e.g.) `Cmd-Space: () => false`
  // Return true to prevent any further keyboard handlers from running.
  keyBindings: {
    ArrowUp: () => {
      selectedIndex = rotateSelectionBackwards(selectedIndex, emojiList.length);
    },
    ArrowDown: () => {
      selectedIndex = rotateSelectionForwards(selectedIndex, emojiList.length);
    },
    Enter: ({ command }) => {
      if (showSuggestions) {
        command(emojiList[selectedIndex]);
      }
    },
    Esc: () => {
      showSuggestions = false;
    },
  },

  onChange: (params) => {
    const query = params.query.full;
    emojiList = sortEmojiMatches({ query, maxResults });
    selectedIndex = 0;
    showSuggestions = true;
  },

  onExit: () => {
    showSuggestions = false;
    emojiList = [];
    selectedIndex = 0;
  },

  // Create a  function that is passed into the change, exit and keybinding handlers.
  // This is useful when these handlers are called in a different part of the app.
  createCommand: ({ match, view }) => {
    return (emoji, skinVariation) => {
      if (!emoji) {
        throw new Error('An emoji is required when calling the emoji suggesters command');
      }

      const tr = view.state.tr;
      const { from, end: to } = match.range;
      tr.insertText(emoji, from, to);
      view.dispatch(tr);
    };
  },
};

// Create the plugin with the above configuration. It also supports multiple plugins being added.
const suggestionPlugin = suggest(suggestEmojis);

// Include the plugin in the created editor state.
const state = EditorState.create({ schema, plugins: [suggestionPlugin] });
```

You can see this example brought to life in the `remirror` codebase under the `@remirror/extension-emoji` and the `@remirror/extension-mention` packages.

The following examples are available for you to try out on the [docs site](https://remirror.io/docs/showcase/social)

**Search emoji on `:` key**

The emojis are inserted as plain text. Itâ€™s up to you whether you insert the emoji as a node, mark or plaintext.

First a laughing emoji then a heart and finally the poop emoji](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ifiokjr/assets/master/remirror/emoji.gif 'A gif showing emoji being inserted after typing the colon (:) key. First a laughing emoji then a heart and finally the poop emoji')

**Editable mention on `@` key**

Each mention is a mark that wraps the mentioned text with a spec property of `inclusive: false`

## Core API

### `suggest`

This creates a suggestion plugin with all the suggesters provided.

<b>Signature:</b>

```ts
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions
(...suggesters: Suggester[]) => Plugin;
```

The priority of the suggesters is the order in which they are passed into this function.

```ts
const plugin = suggest(two, one, three);
```

In the above example `two` will be checked first, then `one` and then `three`.

Only one suggester can match at any given time. The order and specificity of the regex parameters help determines which suggester will be active.

<br />

### `Suggester`

This `Suggester` interface defines all the options required to create a suggester within your editor.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface Suggester<GCommand extends AnyFunction<void> = AnyFunction<void>>
```
