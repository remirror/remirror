       *
       * Some extensions add decorations to the ProsemirrorView based on their
       * state. These decorations can touch any node or mark and it would be
       * very difficult to model this without transforming the complete produced
       * JSX element.
       *
       * An example is that all empty paragraphs in prosemirror automatically
       * have a `<br />` tag injected into them during runtime. The
       * ReactSSRSerializer which transform the `toDOM` method output for
       * paragraph tags `[p, 0]` into JSX `<p />` has no way of knowing about
       * this. That is where this creator method can help. We can transform the
       * automatically generated JSX and inject `<br />` tags for the initial
       * server render. That way there is no jump or layout adjustment when the
       * document first loads on the browser.
