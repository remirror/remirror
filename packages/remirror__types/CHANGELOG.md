### Minor Changes

- [#706](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/pull/706) [`9b4a3bdb8`](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/commit/9b4a3bdb8e1c594d353c5c5be2844133cda0f51a) Thanks [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr)! - Add new package which contains all the non-ProseMirror specific types. The package also re-exports `type-fest` to prevent the need for multiple usages of this library within the codebase.
