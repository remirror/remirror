- Updated dependencies []:
  - @remirror/core@1.2.1

## 1.0.9

> 2021-10-20

### Patch Changes

- Exposes a function `hasUploadingFile` to determine if file uploads are currently taking place.

  When a user drops a file, a file node is created without a href attribute - this attribute is set once the file has uploaded.

  However if a user saves content, before uploads are complete we can be left with "broken" file nodes. This exposed function allows us to check if file uploads are still in progress.

  Addtionally file nodes now render valid DOM attributes. Rather than `href` and `error`, they now render `data-url` and `data-error`.

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: The option `persistentSelectionClass` for `DecorationsExtension` is now `undefined` by default. It needs to be explicitly configured to enable persistent selection. You can set it as `'selection'` to match the default styles provided by `@remirror/styles`.

  If you are using `@remirror/react`, you can enable it like this:

  ```tsx
  import { Remirror, ThemeProvider, useRemirror } from '@remirror/react';

  function Editor(): JSX.Element {
    const { manager } = useRemirror({ builtin: { persistentSelectionClass: 'selection' } });
    return (
      <ThemeProvider>
        <Remirror manager={manager} />
      </ThemeProvider>
    );
  }
  ```

  In the interest of performance, the persistent selection will only be displayed if the editor loses focus.

* Updated dependencies []:
  - @remirror/core@1.2.0

## 1.0.8

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @remirror/core@1.1.1

## 1.0.5

> 2021-08-29

### Patch Changes

- Don't install `@remirror/theme` as a dependency of `@remirror/core`.

* Add a new `UploadExtension` to the built-in preset, which will manage all upload states from `FileExtension` and other extensions in the future.

  **Breaking changes**: `UploadContext` and `FileUploader` are now exported by `@remirror/core` instead of `@remirror/extension-file`.

* Updated dependencies []:
  - @remirror/core@1.1.0

##### Major Changes

For information on what's changed in this release see the [`v1.0.0` release](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

### Minor Changes

- [#886](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/pull/886) [`ce3bd9b06`](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/commit/ce3bd9b069f9d587958c0fc73c8a1d02109e4677) Thanks [@ronnyroeller](https://github.com/ronnyroeller)! - Render horizontalRule by default

* [#881](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/pull/881) [`0ba71790f`](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/commit/0ba71790fcd0b69fb835e744c6dccace120e6ee7) Thanks [@ronnyroeller](https://github.com/ronnyroeller)! - Make react-renderer composable. Before, it was hard to add further node renderer to RemirrorRenderer. Users couldn't use the existing node renderer like `TextHandler` and `CodeBlock` because they weren't exported. This commit simplifies composing a static renderer for the user's needs by exporting the renderers and the interface required to write custom node renderers. As part of the commit, the complex renderer file is split into smaller - easier to understand and test - units.

- [#887](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/pull/887) [`f848ba64b`](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/commit/f848ba64ba686c868c651e004cbbe25e2d405957) Thanks [@ronnyroeller](https://github.com/ronnyroeller)! - Support callout nodes in react-renderer

* [#882](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/pull/882) [`1982aa447`](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/commit/1982aa447706850093d1d544db2c6de2aefa478b) Thanks [@ronnyroeller](https://github.com/ronnyroeller)! - Support static rendering of heading, iframe, link. Added support for some common node types and marks. The iframe and link handler can be parameterized to change the visualization vs the node attributes in RemirrorJSON. For example, it allows to open links in a new tab or set the iframe to a specific width/height (independently of how this was entered in the editor).
