# `TrailingNodeExtension`

## Summary

Ensure that there's always a trailing paragraph at the end of the document.

Why? In some scenarios it is difficult to place a cursor after the last element. This ensures there's always space to select the position afterward.

## Usage

### Installation

This extension is installed for you when you install the main `remirror` package.

You can use the imports in the following way:

```ts
import { TrailingNodeExtension } from 'remirror/extensions';
```

The extension is provided by the `@remirror/extension-trailing-node` package.
