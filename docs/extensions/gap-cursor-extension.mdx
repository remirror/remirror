# `GapCursorExtension`

## Summary

This will capture clicks near and arrow-key-motion past places that don't have a normally selectable position nearby, and create a gap cursor selection for them.

For example, the user normally couldn't move the cursor after a horizontal line, if this is the last node in the document. The gap cursor gives the user the impression that the cursor could be behind the horizontal line, and lets the user type further.

## Styling

The cursor is drawn as an element with class `ProseMirror-gapcursor`. The color (and other attributes) can be styled with CSS:

```css
.remirror-editor.ProseMirror .ProseMirror-gapcursor:after {
  border-top-color: red;
}
```

## Usage

### Installation

It is not necessary to install the `GapCursorExtension` explicitely because it comes as part of the `CorePreset`, i.e. every editor has automatically this extension.

Make sure to import the styles, which make the gap cursor visible:

```ts
import '@remirror/styles/extension-gap-cursor.css';
```
