# `YjsExtension`

## Summary

The YJS extension is the recommended extension for creating a collaborative editor.

## Usage

### Installation

This extension is installed for you when you install the main `remirror` package.

You can use the imports in the following way:

```ts
import { YjsExtension } from 'remirror/extensions';
```

The `yjs` extension provides support for "undo"/"redo" commands, which conflicts with the default `history` extension. The `history` extension provides "undo"/"redo" for the changes done by the _current user_ only, while the `yjs` extension provides "undo"/"redo" on the level of the underlying yjs transactions, which covers changes by _all active users._ Note however that a `yjs` "undo" replaces the complete document, which prevents other extensions (such as the `annotations` extension) from tracking positions.

You can select the `yjs` "undo"/"redo" implementation by disabling the `history` extension in the core preset configuration:

```ts
const { manager } = useRemirror({
  extensions: () => [new YjsExtension({ getProvider })],
  core: {
    excludeExtensions: ['history'],
  },
});
```

Alternatively you can also disable the "undo"/"redo" functionality of the `yjs` extension:

```ts
const { manager } = useRemirror({
  extensions: () => [new YjsExtension({ getProvider, disableUndo: true })],
});
```

_Note that using the `history` extension "undo"/"redo" requires [additional support from the `y-prosemirror` library](https://github.com/yjs/y-prosemirror/pull/91)._
