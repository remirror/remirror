# `FileExtension` <span class="beta" />

## Summary

Adds a file node to the editor

## Beta

Note this extension is in beta, so its API may change without a bump to the major semver version.

## Usage

### Installation

This extension is still in beta so is **not** included in the main `remirror` package.

To install it directly you can use

```ts
import { FileExtension } from '@remirror/extension-file';
```

The extension is provided by the `@remirror/extension-file` package.
