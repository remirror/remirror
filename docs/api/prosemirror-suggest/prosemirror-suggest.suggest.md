## suggest variable

This creates a suggestion plugin with all the suggestions provided.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
suggest: <GSchema extends import("prosemirror-model").Schema<string, string> = any>(...suggesters: Suggester<import("@remirror/core-types").AnyFunction<void>>[]) => Plugin<SuggestState<any>, GSchema>
```

## Remarks

In the following example we're creating an emoji suggestion plugin that responds to the colon character with a query and presents a list of matching emojis based on the query typed so far.

```ts
import { Suggester, suggest } from 'prosemirror-suggest';

const maxResults = 10;
let selectedIndex = 0;
let emojiList: string[] = [];
let showSuggestions = false;

const suggestEmojis: Suggester = {
  // By default decorations are used to highlight the currently matched
  // suggestion in the dom.
  // In this example we don't need decorations (in fact they cause problems when the
  // emoji string replaces the query text in the dom).
  ignoreDecorations: true,
  char: ':', // The character to match against
  name: 'emoji-suggestion', // a unique name
  appendText: '', // Text to append to the created match

  // Keybindings are similar to prosemirror keymaps with a few extra niceties.
  // The key identifier can also include modifiers (e.g.) `Cmd-Space: () => false`
  // Return true to prevent any further keyboard handlers from running.
  keyBindings: {
    ArrowUp: () => {
      selectedIndex = rotateSelectionBackwards(selectedIndex, emojiList.length);
    },
    ArrowDown: () => {
      selectedIndex = rotateSelectionForwards(selectedIndex, emojiList.length);
    },
    Enter: ({ command }) => {
      if (showSuggestions) {
        command(emojiList[selectedIndex]);
      }
    },
    Esc: () => {
      showSuggestions = false;
    },
  },

  onChange: params => {
    const query = params.query.full;
    emojiList = sortEmojiMatches({ query, maxResults });
    selectedIndex = 0;
    showSuggestions = true;
  },

  onExit: () => {
    showSuggestions = false;
    emojiList = [];
    selectedIndex = 0;
  },

  // Create a  function that is passed into the change, exit and keybinding handlers.
  // This is useful when these handlers are called in a different part of the app.
  createCommand: ({ match, view }) => {
    return (emoji,skinVariation) => {
      if (!emoji) {
        throw new Error('An emoji is required when calling the emoji suggestions command');
      }

      const tr = view.state.tr; const { from, end: to } = match.range;
      tr.insertText(emoji, from, to); view.dispatch(tr);
    };
  },
};

 // Create the plugin with the above configuration. It also supports multiple plugins being added.
const suggestionPlugin = suggest(suggestEmojis);

 // Include the plugin in the created editor state.
const state = EditorState.create({schema,
  plugins: [suggestionPlugin],
});

```
The priority of the suggestions is the order in which they are passed into this function.

- `const plugin = suggest(two, one, three)` - Here `two` will be checked first, then `one` and then `three`<!-- -->.

Only one suggestion can match at any given time. The order and specificity of the regex parameters help determines which suggestion will be active.
