# Introduction

This documentation is still a work in progress. It is being updated and still has many iterations before it can be called ready.

While reading through this guide, if you find errors or would like to suggest improvements there are several options.

- Open an issue in our [github repo](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/issues).
- [Join our discord server](https://discord.gg/C4cfrMK) and discuss the problem with us.
- Create a pull request with your proposed improvement by clicking the edit button on the relevant page.

Whatever you decide I'm happy that you've taken the time to dive into the `remirror` project.

## Target audience

This guide is designed for the following:

- Consumers of the library.
- Extension developers.
- Contributors.

Regardless of where you stand, I have endeavoured to make it approachable and interesting for a whole range of developers.

If a section is becoming difficult this guide will endeavour to make it obvious that this is not a easy.

This guide assumes that you're familiar with **JavaScript** and have some understanding of `React`. If you're brand new to programming or JavaScript then many would encourage you to look into other resources before attempting to read through this.
