### Order of marks

Most of the time the order of marks is unimportant. Whether a `<strong />` tag
wraps an `<em />` tag or visa versa has little impact on the user experience.
However in some cases, as with links (anchor tags) it can lead to some odd
behaviour when tags the link tag isn't prioritied.

The following is one statement where the user has created a link and afterward
gone and made some of the text bold. Unfortunately the bold is given priority
and wraps the anchor tag causing the link to be broken around the `<strong />` tag in the
html. The behaviour is consistent but it does look wrong.

```html
<p class="">
  <a href="https://google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">This </a>
  <strong><a href="https://google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IS</a></strong>
  <a href="https://google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> a link</a>
</p>
```

To solve this we just need to ensure that the anchor tag appears in the the
schema first and hence receives priority over all other marks.

```tsx
<RemirrorExtension Constructor={BoldExtension} priority={3}/>
<RemirrorExtension Constructor={LinkExtension} priority={1} /> // Give link a higher priority
```

Now the wrapping makes a lot more sense because prosemirror prioritises the mark
which appears earlier in the schema.

```html
<p class="">
  <a href="https://google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">This<strong>IS</strong> a link</a>
</p>
```
