# Keymaps

:::note

Parts of this document are for more advanced user cases and you probably won't ever need to use them.

Keymaps allow users to use shortcuts to manipulate the text in their editor. `Cmd-b` is an example for setting the selected text to be **bold**.

The following is an example where the enter key can be customised to ignore all lower priority `Enter` key bindings.

The `next` method allows full control beyond the return value. It allows both calling all lower priority key bindings regardless of whether true or false has been called.

```tsx
import { BaseExtensionOptions, extension, KeyBindings, PlainExtension } from 'remirror';

interface CustomKeymapExtensionOptions {
  override?: boolean;
}

@extension({ defaultOptions: { override: false } })
export class CustomKeymapExtension extends PlainExtension<CustomKeymapExtensionOptions> {
  get name() {
    return 'customKeymap' as const;
  }

  /**
   * Injects the baseKeymap into the editor.
   */
  public createKeymap(): KeyBindings {
    const { override } = this.options;

    return {
      Enter({ next }) {
        if (override) {
          // No other commands will be run
          return true;
        }

        next(); // Runs all lower priority commands

        return true;
      },
    };
  }
}
```

### Usage

To use the above example you could do the following.

```ts
import { RemirrorManager } from '@remirror/core';
import { baseExtensions } from '@remirror/core-extensions';

import { CustomKeymapExtension } from './custom-keymap-extension';

const manager = RemirrorManager.create([new CustomKeymapExtension({ override: true })]);
```

This manager can now be used to create an editor where the baseKeymap for the `Enter` key is overridden.

If override is set to `false`, the keybinding will defer to lower priority keybindings while still allowing the behaviour you want for the extension.
