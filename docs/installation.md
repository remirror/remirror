# Installation

Use the installation instruction outlined below, depending on the package manager used in your project.

```bash type=installation
yarn add remirror @remirror/react @remirror/pm
```

```bash
pnpm add remirror @remirror/react @remirror/pm
```

```bash
npm add remirror @remirror/react @remirror/pm
```

Installing `remirror` gives you access to all the extensions and core packages that are actively developed in the [`remirror`](https://github.com/remirror/remirror) repository.

`@remirror/pm` is a peer dependency of `remirror` and all the Remirror packages.

:::note

The `@remirror/pm` dependency provides access to all the core `prosemirror-*` libraries and is used by all the Remirror packages to ensure that each package is using the exact same version of the `prosemirror-*` package. It ensures consistent library versions across the ecosystem and can also simplify your codebase.

If you plan on developing your own extension or framework package then please use `@remirror/pm/state` rather than the `prosemirror-state` packages. Both point to the exact same files but the scoped package means that the versions installed by end users will always be consistent.

:::note

## Styling the editor

Remirror requires styles for the editor to function correctly across different browsers. These styles can be added in the following ways:

With plain css make sure to wrap your editor with the class `.remirror-theme`. This adds the CSS variables with their default values to the dom, for consumption by any editors within this area.

Then import the styles from the `remirror/styles` endpoint as shown below.

```ts
import 'remirror/styles/all.css';
```

The following options assume you have the peer dependencies already installed.

Or with `@emotion/styled`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@remirror/react';
import { AllStyledComponent } from '@remirror/styles/emotion';

import { MyEditor } from './my-editor';

// Wrap your editor with the component.
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <AllStyledComponent>
        <MyEditor />
      </AllStyledComponent>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

Or with `styled-components`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@remirror/react';
import { AllStyledComponent } from '@remirror/styles/styled-components';

import { MyEditor } from './my-editor';

// Wrap your editor with the component.
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <AllStyledComponent>
        <MyEditor />
      </AllStyledComponent>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

Or with `emotion` and the DOM.

```ts
// Or with `emotion` using the DOM
import { THEME } from 'remirror';
import { addStylesToElement, allStyles } from '@remirror/styles/dom';

const wrapperElement = document.createElement('div');
wrapperElement.classList.add(THEME); // Add the css variables to the dom.
addStylesToElement(wrapperElement, allStyles);
```

In order to use the `styled-components` or `emotion` variants you will need to also install `@remirror/styles`.

## Browser support

Remirror aims to be compatible with all browsers released since **2017**.

If you are using remirror with a project like [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) or [`gatsby`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) you will also need to add the following browserlist configuration.

To use this configuration in your own project you can add the following to your `package.json` file. Tools like `babel` and `postcss` are aware of this configuration.

```json
{
  "browserslist": ["since 2017"]
}
```

You can also use a `.browserlistrc` file.

```markup
since 2017
```

The main reason for this configuration is to support class syntax properly. Projects like `next.js` automatically compile your code down to `es5` which causes problems when extending classes. If you don't plan on creating your own extensions or framework, you can ignore this requirement.

Great, lets get started creating your first Remirror editor.
