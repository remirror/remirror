Extensions manage similar concerns. It allows for grouping items that affect:

- How the editor displays certain content, i.e. **bold**, _italic_, **underline**.
- Makes certain commands available e.g. `actions.bold()` to make selected text bold.
- Check if a command is currently active or enabled e.g. `actions.bold.isActive()`.
- Register Prosemirror plugins, keymaps, input rules, paste rules, and custom nodeViews, which
  affect the behaviour of the editor.

There are three types of `Extension`.

- `NodeExtension` - For creating [Prosemirror nodes](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.Node)
  in the editor.
- `MarkExtension` - For creating [Prosemirror marks](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.Mark)
  in the editor.
- `PlainExtension` - For behaviour which doesn't need to be displayed in the DOM.
