## [Unreleased]

### Added

- 🚀 `@remirror/dev`: New package for aiding in developing new extensions and components.
- 🚀 `@remirror/core`: Introduce the concept of meta tags for extensions. These allow an extension to tag itself and these tags are made available through the tag object which is passed to all extension methods.
- 🚀 `@remirror/core`: Add a `helpers` method to extensions. These are similar to commands except they don't have access to the view and shouldn't directly affect the editor. They can also return data and receive custom parameters. They can be accessed with `manager.data.helpers.myHelper()`.
- 🚀 `@remirror/core-extensions`: Add `TrailingNodeExtension` to always append a specified node to the end of the dom.
- `@remirror/core`: Add `getExtraAttrs` method to the extension which can be used in the `(Mark/Node)Extension`.
- 🚀 `@remirror/core`: Add `DropCursorExtension` for a cursor to show up at the exact location an item will be dropped.
- 🚀 `@remirror/core`: Add `GapCursorExtension` for support of tricky to select locations.
- 🚀 `@remirror/ui`: Add several utilities for managing the ui of a remirror editor.

- Introduce new `@builtin` annotation to show when an extension is included by default.
- Introduce new `@schema` annotation for extension options to indicated that an option should not be updated after creating or it will change the schema.

### Changes

- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** `@emotion/core` is now a `peerDependency`. When adding this libray to your project you will need to `yarn add @emotion/core` as well. This is required to prevent bugs with version conflicts within the EmotionThemeProvider.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** `deepMerge` now takes multiple parameters instead of one array of objects to merge.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core` `@remirror/core-extensions` and all extensions:** Refactor ExtensionTypes with a whole set of helpers for better type checking and self documenting types. Now the remirror component can receive the List of Extensions and from this infer the nodes, marks and actions available on any editor. Currently this inference has only been added to the Wysiwyg editor but will be added to the Twitter editor and all future editors.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core` `@remirror/core-extensions`:** Move `ParagraphExtension` from core to core-extensions. The reason is to not pollute the core library with formatting methods which are primarily just for extensions.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Rename `ExtensionType.EXTENSION = 'extension'` to `ExtensionType.Plain = 'plain'`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/ui`:** Rename `@remirror/react-components` to `@remirror/ui`. It is now the base component that will be used for all ui related functionality.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react-utils`:** Refactor the type signature of node views and improve their design. Now node view takes attrs and options.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** Rename `NodeViewPortalComponent` to `RemirrorPortals` since it now supports decorations.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/editor-social`:** Rename `@remirror/editor-twitter` to `@remirror/editor-social` for branding reasons.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Rename `NodeViewPortalContainer` to `PortalContainer`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Refactor the type signature of SSRComponents to only take a node and options `extraAttrs` configuration to enable parsing the dom.

- `@remirror/core`: Update `extraAttrs` configuration to enable parsing the dom.
- `@remirror/core`: Make default priority level for extensions `3` instead of `2`. A lower number means the extension is deemed more important and ordered earlier in lists.
- `@remirror/core-extensions`: Add `extraAttrs` to the following extensions: `LinkExtension`, `ParagraphExtension`, `HeadingExtension`.

### Remove

- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react-utils`:** Remove placeholder prop from the `RemirrorManager`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** Remove `withoutEmotion` prop. This should now be configured via the `RemirrorThemeProvider` component.

## [0.4.1] - 2019-07-22

### Changes

- `@remirror/showcase`: Allow the `ExampleWysiwygEditor` to use prop `suppressHydrationWarning` for SSR rendering.
- `@remirror/showcase`: Revert unintended renaming of `ExampleTwitterEditor` to `ShowcaseTwitterEditor`.

## [0.4.0] - 2019-07-22

### Added

- 🚀 `@remirror/extension-collaboration`: Collaboration library added based on the brilliant example available in [tiptap](https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap).
- 🚀 `@remirror/extension-mention`: Mentions can now be picked up from pasting data.
- 🚀 `@remirror/extension-code-block`: Add commands `toggleCodeBlock`, `createCodeBlock`, `updateCodeBlock` and `formatCodeBlock`, add keymap support for formatting, add backspace support for better navigation and other features.
- `@remirror/core`: Add `CommandNodeTypeParams`, `CommandMarkTypeParams`, `CommandTypeParams` which is now passed to the `commands` method for extensions.
- `@remirror/react-utils`, `@remirror/react`: Add `suppressHydrationWarning` prop to `Remirror` component. Set to true to ignore the hydration warning for a mismatch between the server and client content.
- `@remirror/core`: Add new `extensionData` method to the `ExtensionManager` which allows the extension to provide data on every transaction which will be available for consumption in the renderProp, React Context hooks and HOC's.
- `@remirror/core`: Add `getActions` to the params of all extension manager methods. This will throw an error if called before initialization.
- `@remirror/core`: Allow extensions to override `baseExtension` in the `RemirrorManager` component.
- `@remirror/core`: Add `ensureTrailingParagraph` as a configuration option for the paragraph node. In some scenarios, it is difficult to place a cursor after the last element. This ensures there's always space to select the position afterwards and fixes a whole range of issues. It defaults to false otherwise it breaks a lot of tests.
- `jest-prosemirror`: Enable editorViewOptions for the `createEditor` method. For example, now it is possible to intercept transactions with the `dispatchTransaction` hook.
- `@remirror/renderer-react`: Pass extension options through to SSR components as a prop.

- Add internal modifier key functions for puppeteer testing.
- Add integration editor tests for the `Wysiwyg` editor.

### Changes

- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Change the way commands are configured. The command function on extensions now only accepts an object with the command names being globally unique. For example, the heading extension used to return a function now it returns an object with the following signature.

```ts
{
  toggleHeading(attrs?: Attrs<{level: number}>): CommandFunction;
}
```

This command can now be accessed via `actions.toggleHeading({ level: 2 })`

This is a large breaking change and may cause a lot of your existing code to stop working 😢. However, it paves the way for a better development experience, a simpler to manage library and some exciting features using type inference. Please do bear with me as I make these changes. I truly believe they'll be worthwhile.

- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Change usage `isEnabled` and `isActive` which are now methods on the command. e.g. `actions.toggleHeading.isEnabled()` would check whether the toggle heading button can be used at this moment.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Change Extension function signature actions of `active` and `enabled`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Rename `getEditorState` to `getState`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Change method `getPortalContainer` to property `portalContainer` on the extension manager.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/extension-mention`:** Complete rewrite of internals and public API with better tests and more robust editing.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/extension-mention`:** Change `MentionExtension` from `NodeType` to `MarkType`. Text is now editable after a mention is created.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** Rename `setChildAsRoot` to `childAsRoot` on `RemirrorContextProviderProps` and all it consumers. This affects the `RemirrorContextProvider`, `RemirrorProvider` and `ManagedRemirrorProvider` exports. The prop now can take a boolean or the object with props to inject into the root.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** All RemirrorProviders now require a `children` prop. This prevents a bug when rendering in non-dom environments.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** `dispatchTransaction` has been renamed to `onDispatchTransaction`. It now must return a `transaction` and can be used to edit the transaction that will be used to create a new state.

- 🐛 `@remirror/core`: Fix bug with extension manager failing to provide attributes from the extensions.
- 🐛 `@remirror/core`: Fix TypeScript type of SSRComponent. Change from `Component` to `ComponentType`.
- 🐛 `@remirror/editor-twitter`: Fix bug where text area didn't expand to the full height of editor container.
- 🐛 `@remirror/editor-wysiwyg`: Fix bug where positioner was causing the editor to take up 10000 px in height.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-07-06

### Added

- `@remirror/react`: Add `withoutEmotion` which, when set to `true`, removes emotion (css-in-js) from the `Remirror` component. This is for those who don't like css-in-js and would like to work directly with the raw editor without random styles injected. Consuming the `@remirror/react-components` or any of the `@remirror/editor-*` packages will require the use of emotion.
- `@remirror/react-utils`: Add `oneChildOnly` export which throws readable errors for invalid children props.

### Changed

- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react-utils`:** Rename `childIsFunction` to `propIsFunction` and make it a _pseudo_ predicate function (returns true when it doesn't throw an error).
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** Rename `setChildAsRoot` to `childAsRoot` on `RemirrorContextProviderProps` and all it consumers. This affects the `RemirrorContextProvider`, `RemirrorProvider` and `ManagedRemirrorProvider` exports. The prop now can take a boolean or the object with props to inject into the root.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/editor-twitter`:** Rename `uiTwitterTheme` to `TwitterEditorTheme`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Rename `HasExtensions` to `ExtensionListParams`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** It is now up to extensions to decide whether commands should be active when the editor is editable. `isEditable` method is now passed into the `commands` method as a means of checking.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react`:** All RemirrorProviders now require a `children` prop. This prevents a bug when rendering in non-dom environments.

- Add support for [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
- `@remirror/editor-twitter`, `@remirror/editor-wysiwyg` : Use image-snapshot testing to ensure SSR and DOM rendered editors are identical.
- Update husky command from ~~`yarn stop:hooks`~~ and ~~`yarn start:hooks`~~ to `yarn husky:stop` and `yarn husky:start`.

### Remove

- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/react-utils` `@remirror/react` `@remirror/editor-markdown` `@remirror/editor-wysiwyg`:** Remove customRootProp from `RemirrorProps`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Remove `isEditable` guard from command functions. It is now up to the command or the caller to decide if it should run when the editor is not editable. To help with this command params with the method `isEditable` are passed to the `commands` method of the extension.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/core`:** Remove exports `GetItemParamsMethod`
  `createFlexibleFunctionMap` `hasExtensionProperty` `extensionPropertyMapper` `transformExtensionMap` `ignoreFunctions`.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-06-18

### Added

- Support for server side rendering (SSR) with passing integration tests for NextJS.
- Support for plain extension with styles impacting SSR (PlaceholderExtension can be rendered in SSR).
- **`@remirror/core`:** `ssrTransformer` added to extension methods as a way of wrapping and transforming the JSX element produced on the server.
- **`@remirror/core`:** `SSRComponent: React.ComponentType<any>` option added to `MarkExtensionOptions` and `NodeExtensionOptions` as a way of overriding the component rendered in an SSR environment.
- **`@remirror/core`:** `SSRHelpersExtension` added as a shorthand way of defining SSR transformations via ssrTransformer.
- **`@remirror/core`:** `injectBrIntoEmptyParagraphs` added for better SSR rendering.
- **`@remirror/react-utils`:** `isReactFragment` added to test if an element is a fragment.
- Create better unit tests for SSR.
- Add a changelog with changes starting from `v0.1.0`

### Changed

- 💥 **BREAKING:** Rename `@remirror/ui-*` packages to `@remirror/editor-*` for example @remirror/ui-twitter is .now called `@remirror/editor-twitter`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/editor-twitter`:** Rename `UITwitter` and `TwitterUI` to `TwitterEditor`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/editor-markdown`:** Rename `UIMarkdown` and `MarkdownUI` to `MarkdownEditor`.
- 💥 **BREAKING `@remirror/editor-wysiwyg`:** Rename `UIWysiwyg` and `WysiwygUI` to `WysiwygEditor`.
- Speed up tslint by enforcing linting on individual modules (new `tsconfig.lint.json` files).
- Remove `cx` import from `emotion` library in from `@remirror/core` to reduce the bundle size.
- Set `@emotion/core` and `@emotion/styled` as peer dependencies.

### Remove

- 💥 **BREAKING:** `@remirror/ui-*` packages.
