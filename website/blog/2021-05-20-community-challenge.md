_TLDR: NEXT to support development of open source editor Remirror_

<!-- truncate -->

The last months of Remirror‚Äôs life have all been about creating a stable, pleasant-to-use API. And finally, we‚Äôre getting close to something that will deserve the ‚Äúv1‚Äù label! üí™

Time to look forward. Remirror‚Äôs vision has been to be ‚Äúyour friendly, world-class ProseMirror editor toolkit‚Äù. A pleasant-to-use API is the cornerstone ‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs not all. Providing a rich set of features out-of-the-box will allow developers to create mind-blowing experiences from day one.

So far, many of the current feature extensions came from community members. To name just a few: [@ocavue](https://github.com/ocavue) contributed CodeRemirror and tables, [@whawker](https://github.com/whawker) created the callouts, and [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie) donated the Playground.

Building on this, let‚Äôs start a challenge to add more features as a community! üöÄ

To make this more exciting, [NEXT](https://www.nextapp.co/) is supporting the challenge. We pledge to donate $50 for each of the first 10 implemented issues and special bounties of up to $500 for some selected features!

How does it work? Implement an issue, get your PR merged, and you will receive the bounty.

You can receive the bounty via GitHub sponsors or sourcebounty. Please reach out in case both options aren‚Äôt available in your geographic region.

Happy coding!
