_TLDR: Remirror is ready for prime time._

<!-- truncate -->

After 2.5 years of development and over 200 pre-releases, we’re excited to introduce Remirror v1!

🎯 The overarching goal for v1 was to bring the Remirror core into a shape that can stay **stable for the foreseeable future**. This work was guided by our learnings from the 0.x releases and by the feedback from community members who use Remirror in production.

✨ The v1 release features some **major highlights**:

- Simplified APIs for hooks, commands, and positioners
- Chainable commands
- Prepackaged components for common use cases
- Expanded documentation and storybook

🏎️ Use one of the **tutorials** to give the v1 release a spin:

- [5 min tutorial](/docs/5-min-tutorial): Build an app with a pre-packaged editor
- [Getting started](/docs/getting-started/installation): Build your own tailor-made editor and learn about the core concepts underlying Remirror

⬆️ **Migrate** from earlier versions:

- To upgrade from 1.0.0-next._ / pr706._ pre-release: [Guide](/blog/migration-1.0.0)
- To upgrade from earlier 0.11.\* releases: The library has changed significantly and you'd be better off browsing the documentation. Please reach out on [Discord](https://remirror.io/chat) if you need any help.

🙏 A big thanks to [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) and all the other contributors who made the release possible!
