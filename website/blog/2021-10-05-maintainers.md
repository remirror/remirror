_TLDR: New guard of maintainers will focus on easing adoption and adding more in-depth features._

<!-- truncate -->

### ü¶ò Time for change

Over the last 2.5 years, [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) has done an outstanding job to lay the foundations of Remirror: Bold and visionary, he claimed the land on which we all can build. The recent v1 release marks the end of Remirror‚Äôs ‚ÄúStorm and Stress‚Äù phase. From here, the project‚Äôs focus will shift from groundbreaking changes to further maturing for on-scale use in production apps.

### üôå New team

This shift of focus has been accompanied by a gradual shift of contributors. While [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) guided the community to put the final pieces in place for v1, others stepped up to help the community, fix bugs, and contribute new features. After 6 months of transition, it‚Äôs time to officially hand over to the new guard of maintainers:

- [@ocavue](https://github.com/ocavue)
- [@ronnyroeller](https://github.com/ronnyroeller)
- [@whawker](https://github.com/whawker)

### üß≠ Direction forward

Remirror wants to make ProseMirror fun to use for React developers. It comes with beautiful out-of-the-box editors and allows to build powerful custom editors. The new team wants to keep on easing adoption and adding more in-depth features. Some of these efforts are well on their way: more comprehensive documentation, improved lists, and better file support to name a few. Importantly, we‚Äôre confident that we found a sustainable setup as all maintainers do use Remirror in their day jobs in production apps.
